Replace the placeholder node renderer with proper shape rendering and a drag preview.

## Implementation

1. Replace the placeholder node shape rendering.
  - rectangle, pill and circle should use CSS styling
  - diamond , hexagon and cylinder should render with SVG shapes
  - SVG shapes should scale with node size
  - Keep borders subtle at rest and brighter when selected 

2. Add a shape drag preview
    - When dragging a shape from the shape panel, show a ghost preview of that shape
    - keep the preview attached to the cursor while dragging
    - use the same shape type and default size that will be used on drop
    - hide the preview after the shape is dropped or drag is cancelled 
    - keep this limited to drag preview behavior only

3. Make sure the text within the shape selected can be edited 

## Scope Limits 
- don't rebuild shape panel layout
- don't change how dropped nodes are created
- don't add resize or label editing yet 
- keep drag/drop changes limited to the ghost preview only

## Check when done

- Nodes render the correct shape variant for each type 
- CSS shapes render correctly for rectangle, pill and circle.
- SVG shapes render and scale correctly for diamond , hexagon and cylinder.
- Shape dragging shows a ghost preview matching the dragged shape.
- The text within the shapes is editable 
- `pnpm run build` passes without type errors
